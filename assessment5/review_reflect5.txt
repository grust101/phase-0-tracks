Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
They help improve the efficiency of creating algorithms!
Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
An array is an integer indexed collection of objects. They contain array = []
3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
Different phone numbers
Different zip codes
Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
Collection of key and values that uses any data type
5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
Listing family members and their age
Listing grocery items and quanity

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
You can access a large amount of data in a more efficient manner throughout your code
7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Making guacamole! You could use a hash to list all the ingredients and quantity of them and then use iteration to access the keys and values later in your code. 

Blocks
8. What is a block?
Moveable code that can be run repeatedly. Doesnâ€™t have a name!
9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
A block parameter inside a pipe and is dependent on the method you're calling.
