What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

The key element of Linux is that it is open source software. That mean that it is free for everyone to use. This makes is possible for testing, modifying, and developing for anyone who is interested in doing so. 

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

it's a vertual server that is basically a copy of an operating system that you can then use on your own from anywhere. 

Advantages: 1. they are stable and have good performance. 2. you get complete control of your server where with shared hosting you do not. 3. it's easy to scale if you need to later on. 4. it's good for the environment!

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It's a bad idea because the root user is basically the admin and if you mess things up as the admin they are messed up foundationally which ruins your entire system. You want to run it as some other non-admin user so that the core of your system remains unchanged.
